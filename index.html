            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently an undergraduate student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science. I have a strong academic record with a GPA of 3.92. My educational journey has also taken me to the University of California, Berkeley, where I was an exchange student, excelling in courses such as Numerical Analysis, Optimization Models, and Several Complex Variables.</p>
            <p>My professional experience includes an internship at Shanghai UniDT Technology, where I worked on building a large language model for the insurance sector and developed a text segmentation and visualization module for hierarchical classification. Additionally, I participated in a project at the University of Cambridge, focusing on dynamic states in cortical circuits and optimizing neural network structures. At HUST, I have been involved in research groups exploring differential manifolds, Fourier analysis, and convex analysis theory.</p>
            <p>Beyond academics and research, I actively engage in social activities, including organizing university alumni events and performing in drama productions. My contributions to the field of mathematics have been recognized with awards in various mathematical modeling contests.</p>
